# Digital Identity for Educational Credentials (DIEC)

A blockchain-based platform for secure, verifiable, and portable educational credentials.

## Overview

The Digital Identity for Educational Credentials (DIEC) platform leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize how academic achievements and professional skills are verified, certified, and shared. By creating tamper-proof digital records of educational accomplishments, this system empowers learners with ownership of their credentials while providing employers and institutions with instantly verifiable proof of qualifications.

## System Architecture

The DIEC platform consists of four primary smart contracts:

1. **Student Verification Contract**
    - Validates the identity of learners through secure digital verification
    - Creates cryptographic identity anchors with privacy-preserving features
    - Manages educational identity across multiple institutions
    - Supports various authentication methods (biometric, institutional, etc.)
    - Prevents credential fraud through robust identity verification

2. **Achievement Certification Contract**
    - Records completed courses, degrees, certificates, and academic programs
    - Issues tamper-proof digital diplomas and course completion certificates
    - Maintains cryptographic proof of institutional endorsement
    - Tracks academic progression and educational milestones
    - Supports revocation and amendment processes when necessary

3. **Skill Verification Contract**
    - Documents specific competencies and skills acquired through education
    - Maps coursework and experiences to standardized skill taxonomies
    - Enables micro-credentialing and competency-based education verification
    - Incorporates peer endorsements and practical assessments
    - Allows for skill decay modeling and recertification tracking

4. **Employer Verification Contract**
    - Manages controlled access to credential information
    - Implements consent-based sharing of educational records
    - Provides instant verification of qualifications without intermediaries
    - Maintains audit logs of credential access and verification
    - Supports automated credential matching for job requirements

## Key Features

- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Learners maintain control over their educational data
- **Instant Verification**: Employers can verify credentials without contacting institutions
- **Tamper-Proof Records**: Immutable blockchain storage prevents credential forgery
- **Portable Credentials**: Qualifications easily transferred across borders and institutions
- **Granular Privacy Controls**: Selective disclosure of specific credentials or skills
- **Lifelong Learning Record**: Continuous documentation of formal and informal education
- **Standardized Skill Representation**: Common framework for describing competencies

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- Truffle framework
- Ganache (for local development)
- Web3.js
- Metamask or similar Ethereum wallet

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/diec.git
   cd diec
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

4. Deploy to local development blockchain:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

### Configuration

1. Configure the network settings in `truffle-config.js` for your target deployment network
2. Set up environment variables for API keys and external identity providers
3. Configure educational standards in `config/credential-standards.json`

## Usage

### For Students/Learners

```javascript
// Example: Creating a student identity
const studentContract = await StudentVerification.deployed();
await studentContract.createIdentity(verificationDocuments, biometricHash, institutionalEndorsements);

// Example: Sharing credentials with an employer
const employerContract = await EmployerVerification.deployed();
await employerContract.grantAccess(employerId, credentialIds, accessDuration, accessLevel);
```

### For Educational Institutions

```javascript
// Example: Issuing a degree certificate
const achievementContract = await AchievementCertification.deployed();
await achievementContract.issueDegree(studentId, degreeDetails, programCompletion, institutionalSignature);

// Example: Certifying specific skills
const skillContract = await SkillVerification.deployed();
await skillContract.certifySkills(studentId, skillsList, assessmentResults, certifierIdentity);
```

### For Employers

```javascript
// Example: Requesting credential verification
const employerContract = await EmployerVerification.deployed();
await employerContract.requestAccess(studentId, requiredCredentials, purpose);

// Example: Verifying a specific credential
const verificationResult = await employerContract.verifyCredential(credentialId, issuerInformation);
```

## Digital Wallets

The platform includes a digital wallet for credential management:

- Storage of all educational achievements and certifications
- Self-sovereign identity controls
- Selective sharing of credentials
- Mobile-friendly interface
- Offline verification capabilities

## Security Considerations

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Verify qualifications without revealing sensitive data
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security for credential access
- **Institutional Signatures**: Cryptographic proof of issuing authority
- **Smart Contract Auditing**: Regular security audits required
- **Decentralized Identity Standards**: Compliance with DID and VC specifications

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify contract functionality:

```
truffle test
```

Test coverage includes:
- Student identity creation and verification
- Credential issuance and certification
- Skill taxonomy mapping and verification
- Consent-based access control and sharing

## Interoperability

The platform supports major educational credential standards:

- Open Badges compliance
- Verifiable Credentials (W3C) compatibility
- European Diploma Supplement format
- PESC and IMS Global standards
- Integration with EMREX and Europass

## Deployment

### Testnet Deployment

For testing on Ethereum testnets:

```
truffle migrate --network sepolia
```

### Production Deployment

For deploying to production networks:

```
truffle migrate --network mainnet
```

## Integration APIs

RESTful APIs are available for integration with:
- Student Information Systems (SIS)
- Learning Management Systems (LMS)
- Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)
- Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS)
- Professional licensing bodies

## Privacy Framework

The platform implements a comprehensive privacy approach:
- GDPR and FERPA compliance built-in
- Right to be forgotten (with credential preservation)
- Data minimization principles
- Purpose-limited data sharing
- User-controlled disclosure settings
